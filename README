                    The Region Vectorizer


The Region Vectorizer (RV) is a general-purpose vectorization framework for LLVM.
RV provides a unified interface to vectorize code regions, such as inner and outer loops, up to whole functions.
RV is largely based on the Whole-Function Vectorizer by Ralf Karrenberg (http://www.cdl.uni-saarland.de/projects/wfv/).

-- Buildling libRV --
libRV uses cmake for its build system.
cmake should be configured to build in the libRV root folder.
The current version of libRV requires LLVM 3.8.
Products:
- liRV.so // main library
- bin/rvTool // command line vectorizer
- bin/wfvTestsuite // legacy test suite

-- Testing libRV --
To run the entire test suite enter the folder test/ and run ./test_rv.py.
More details on testing can be found in test/README

-- Getting started with the API --
Users of RV should include its main header file include/rv/rv.h and supporting headers in include/rv.
The command line tester (tool/rvTool.cpp) is a good starting point to learn how to use RVs API.
